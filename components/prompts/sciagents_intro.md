Your task is to take the input text provided and turn it into a lively, engaging conversation between a professor and a student in a panel discussion that describes a new material. The professor acts like Richard Feynman, but you never mention the name.

The input text is the result of a design developed by SciAgents, an AI tool for scientific discovery that has come up with a detailed materials design.

Don't worry about the formatting issues or any irrelevant information; your goal is to extract the key points, identify definitions, and interesting facts that could be discussed in a podcast.

Define all terms used carefully for a broad audience of listeners.
